function [nvGpSyncStruc] = processNVgpioPy(varargin) % time, sync, io1) % (pyGpioStruc)

% Clay 2017
% This is a function to take output from the export_gpio.py script from
% Inscopix, and to process nVista frame times and med associates sync signals (io1).
% First: run from cmd
% python export_gpio.py --sync --trigger --io1 --io2 inFilename outTxtFilename
% and this will output a text file to select in this script

% This is a bit tricky because of the way that the signals are represented
% in the TXT file output by the python script. Basically, the signals are
% only recorded when there is a change in any of the input signals, and
% this is given a timestamp. This can be a frame change, trigger, or any
% input signal. Here are a few notes on this:
% 1.) While frame tells the frame number (since the system is started, not
% from the beginning of actual capture), the sync signal is not "1" on the
% first row for that frame, but the second
% [2.) Time is represented from the system time, so you have to subtract the
% first time from the time array to get the time relative to the start
% time] NOTE: I don't think this is true anymore...
% 3.) Time is in secs.
% 4.) Using this method, the nVista frame times show more variation than if
% one used the CSV export from Mosaic. So they either process this frame
% data differently or they regularize this when exporting.

[filename, path] = uigetfile('.txt', 'Select TXT file of Python exported nVista gpio');
else
    filename = varargin{1};
    path = [pwd '\'];

io1 = dataTable{:,5};   % similarly for GPIO#1/TTL behav sync signal
io2 = dataTable{:,6};

% NOTE: events are represented in a weird way in the nvista file-
% Basically, anytime a signal changes (of whatever sort) the time (and
% frame) of that event is logged with the change (e.g. 0 to 1, signal goes
% on or off, or frame changes).
